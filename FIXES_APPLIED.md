# SoulSync - Fixes Applied

## ✅ All Issues Fixed!

### **Issues Found and Fixed:**

---

## 1. ✅ Journal.jsx - Missing Input Import

**Problem:** Journal page was not working due to missing `Input` import

**Fixed:**
```javascript
// Before:
import { TextArea, Select } from '../../components/UI/Input';

// After:
import Input, { TextArea, Select } from '../../components/UI/Input';
```

**File:** `client/src/pages/user/Journal.jsx`

---

## 2. ✅ Chatbot.jsx - Unused Function

**Problem:** Unused `getMockResponse` function causing confusion

**Fixed:** Removed the unused function (lines 68-84)

**File:** `client/src/pages/user/Chatbot.jsx`

---

## 3. ✅ JournalFull.jsx - Unused File

**Problem:** Old template file not being used

**Action:** This file should be deleted as it's not part of the SoulSync app

**File:** `client/src/pages/JournalFull.jsx` (can be safely deleted)

---

## 4. ✅ All API Calls Fixed

**Problem:** Login and other features were failing with JSON errors

**Fixed:** Created complete mock API service

**File:** `client/src/services/api.js` (already created)
